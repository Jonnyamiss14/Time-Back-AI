# Introducing TimeBack AI: Bespoke Training That Actually Works

After five years of working directly with schools and employment providers, I've seen the same pattern repeat itself: well-meaning AI initiatives that promise the world but deliver frustration, confusion, and ultimately, abandonment.

The problem isn't AI itself—it's how we're teaching people to use it.

## The Problem with Generic AI Training

Most AI training falls into one of two camps:

1. **Technical deep-dives** that overwhelm non-technical staff with jargon and complexity
2. **Surface-level overviews** that leave people knowing AI exists but not how to actually use it

Neither approach works for the people who need AI most: frontline staff dealing with real challenges every day.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="The Reality Check">
85% of AI training initiatives fail to achieve lasting behaviour change because they don't address the specific contexts where people actually work.
</InfoBox>

## Why TimeBack AI is Different

### Built by Someone Who's Done the Job

I'm not a tech consultant who's read about education and employment services. I've been:

- A primary school teacher managing 30+ students
- A SENCO writing behaviour plans at 11pm
- A prison educator with impossible caseloads
- A senior caseworker hitting targets while supporting vulnerable clients
- An operations manager trying to prove impact to commissioners

Every training module we create is tested against this simple question: **Would this have actually helped me when I was doing that job?**

### Human-Centred, Not Tech-Centred

Our approach starts with people, not technology:

1. **Listen** - What are your actual pain points?
2. **Design** - Custom training for your specific context
3. **Embed & Measure** - Ongoing support until it sticks

### Outcomes-First Methodology

We don't measure success by how many people attended training. We measure it by:

- Time saved on administrative tasks
- Quality improvements in core work
- Staff confidence and job satisfaction
- Measurable impact on client outcomes

## What We Deliver

### For Schools
- **SLT Strategy Days** - AI governance and implementation roadmaps
- **Train-the-Trainer** - Equip your champions to cascade learning
- **Advisor Accelerator** - Hands-on sessions for frontline staff

Focus areas include lesson planning scaffolds, behaviour plan wizards, parent communication drafts, and assessment criteria assistants.

### For Employment Providers
- Vacancy sourcing prompts that actually work
- UC-aware cover letter generation
- Evidence pack builders for job readiness
- Commissioner report helpers that demonstrate impact

### For Both
- **Plain-English approach** - No jargon, no complexity
- **LLM-agnostic training** - Works with Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini
- **Ofsted-aware content** - Aligned with inspection frameworks
- **Measurable outcomes** - Clear success metrics from day one

## The TimeBack Promise

✅ **Training that sticks** - 6-month follow-up support included

## Ready to Give Your Staff Time Back?

The AI revolution is happening whether we're ready or not. The question isn't whether to embrace AI—it's whether you'll do it in a way that actually helps your people and improves your outcomes.

If you're tired of AI training that doesn't work, let's talk.
