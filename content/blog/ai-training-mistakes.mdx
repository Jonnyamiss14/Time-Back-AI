# 5 AI Training Mistakes That Waste Everyone's Time

I've seen it happen dozens of times: organisations invest thousands in AI training, staff attend enthusiastically, and six months later, nothing has changed. The AI tools sit unused, the processes remain the same, and everyone concludes that "AI isn't for us."

The problem isn't AI. It's how we're teaching it.

Here are the five biggest mistakes I see organisations make with AI training—and how to avoid them.

## Mistake #1: Starting with the Technology

**What happens:** Training begins with "Here's ChatGPT, here's how to write prompts, here are 50 use cases."

**Why it fails:** People don't care about AI. They care about their problems. When you start with technology, you're asking people to learn something abstract before they understand why it matters.

**The fix:** Start with pain points. Ask your team: "What takes too long? What's frustrating? What would you do if you had an extra hour each day?" Then show how AI addresses those specific issues.

Begin every AI training session with: "By the end of today, you'll save 30 minutes on [specific task]. Here's how..."
</InfoBox>

## Mistake #2: Generic Training for Specific Roles

**What happens:** The same AI overview gets delivered to teachers, support staff, administrators, and leadership.

**Why it fails:** A SENCO's AI needs are completely different from a headteacher's. Generic training feels irrelevant to everyone.

**The fix:** Role-specific training that addresses actual workflows. Teachers need lesson planning help. SENCOs need behaviour plan assistance. Administrators need report generation support.

## Mistake #3: Ignoring the Fear Factor

**What happens:** Training assumes everyone is excited about AI and ready to dive in.

**Why it fails:** Many staff are genuinely worried about job security, making mistakes, or looking incompetent. Ignoring these fears doesn't make them disappear.

**The fix:** Address concerns head-on. Acknowledge that AI will change work, but emphasise human-AI collaboration, not replacement. Share examples of people using AI to become better at their jobs, not to eliminate their jobs.

## Mistake #4: One-and-Done Training

**What happens:** A half-day workshop, maybe some follow-up materials, then everyone's expected to become AI-proficient.

**Why it fails:** Behaviour change takes time and practice. Without ongoing support, people revert to familiar methods when they hit obstacles.

**The fix:** Plan for a learning journey, not a training event:
- Initial workshop to build confidence
- Practice sessions with real scenarios
- Peer support networks
- Regular check-ins and troubleshooting
- Advanced sessions as confidence grows

Research shows it takes 66 days on average to form a new habit. Plan your AI training timeline accordingly.

## Mistake #5: No Success Metrics

**What happens:** Training is delivered, attendance is recorded, and everyone assumes success.

**Why it fails:** Without measuring actual behaviour change and outcomes, you can't tell if training worked or how to improve it.

**The fix:** Define success before training begins:
- What specific tasks should people be doing differently?
- How much time should they be saving?
- What quality improvements should you see?
- How will you measure confidence and satisfaction?

## The Right Way to Do AI Training

Based on working with dozens of organisations, here's what actually works:

### 1. Start with Problems, Not Solutions
Map your team's biggest time-wasters and frustrations before introducing any AI tools.

### 2. Make it Immediately Relevant
Every training example should reflect real work your people do every day.

### 3. Build Confidence Gradually
Start with simple, low-risk applications where success is almost guaranteed.

### 4. Provide Ongoing Support
Plan for months of follow-up, not hours.

### 5. Measure What Matters
Track behaviour change, time savings, and quality improvements—not just attendance.

## Common Objections (And How to Handle Them)

**"We don't have time for extensive training"**
You don't have time NOT to do this properly. Poor AI training wastes more time than no training at all.

**"Our staff aren't technical"**
Good AI training doesn't require technical skills. It requires understanding how to solve problems more efficiently.

**"AI tools keep changing"**
Train principles and thinking patterns, not specific button clicks. Good AI training creates adaptable learners.

## The Bottom Line

AI training fails when it focuses on technology instead of people. It succeeds when it addresses real problems, builds genuine confidence, and provides ongoing support.

Your staff want to be more effective at their jobs. AI can help them get there. But only if you teach it in a way that actually works.
